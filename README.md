# QLearning

This repository is to make understanding basics of Reinforcement Learning easy for beginners and to give good intuition about how Bellman's equation helps RL algorithms learn. It currently includes a customizable grid world environment that is presented with visuals that are easy to understand and corerlate with the learning algorithm behind the scenes.

Any suggestions are welcome.
